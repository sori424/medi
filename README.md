Here's the flow of the main function. Users take picture of the medicine number from prescriptions and then automatically cropped the image area with numbers. Then users can fix the numbers manually if there's error. By the given number, users get information of the medicine which is uploaded on the users' own database automatically. Therefore, our secondary function of medi is as below.
